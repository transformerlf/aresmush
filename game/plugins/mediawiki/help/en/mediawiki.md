# Mediawiki Pages

The mediawiki tool helps you create wiki pages on Mediawiki.

`mw` - View the wiki's address.

## Character Page

If your game allows, you can auto-create a character's wiki page.  If your game does not support auto-creation, or if the page already exists, the command will print out a wiki template to your screen.  This can be copied/pasted to the wiki in whole or in part.

`mw/char [<name>]` - Creates a wiki page for a character.

## Log Page

You can also create wiki logs for scenes run through the [Scenes](/help/scenes) system.  As with character wiki pages, this command will either auto-create the page on the wiki or present you with a template (suitable for copy/paste), depending on your game's settings.

`mw/log <scene#>` - Creates a wiki page for a scene log.
